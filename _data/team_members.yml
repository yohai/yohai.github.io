   Yamin is working on incorporating our [Neural-based method for calculating entropy](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2017042117) 
   into molecular dynamics simulations. The aim is to use neurally-estimated entropy as a collective variable in MD simulations
   that would allow effective sampling of entropically stabilized phases. Yamin is co-advised by [Dr. Barak Hirshberg](https://hirshberg-group.webflow.io/) from the school of Chemistry.

    Amit is looking at the random dynamics of interacting colloidal particles
    to see what we can learn about their interactions from their kinematics. 
    This work is in collaboration with [Roy Beck's lab](https://www.becklab.sites.tau.ac.il/).

  alumni: true
  info: >
   Shachaf is looking at a geometrical description of soft mechanical meta-materials. 
   He's using  [our recently developed formalism](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.1920237117), 
   to study disordered metamaterials and understand emergent phenomena such as the collapse
   dynamics, localization properties and more.
